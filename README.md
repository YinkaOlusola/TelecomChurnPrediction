# **CUSTOMER CHURN PREDICTION**

# **Introduction**

In the dynamic landscape of business, customer churn, or the departure of customers from a product or service, is a critical metric that significantly impacts the success or failure of a company.

The telecommunications industry, serving as a cornerstone for connectivity services, faces the challenge of predicting and minimizing customer churn. The churn rate, measured over a specific time frame, reflects the percentage of customers discontinuing services, highlighting the need for effective customer retention strategies.

Customer churn is particularly pertinent in industries with multiple options for consumers, where dissatisfaction or difficulties can prompt users to explore alternatives. For businesses, the cost of acquiring new customers surpasses that of retaining existing ones. Successful customer retention not only increases the average lifetime value but also enhances the sustainability and growth potential of a company. In this context, customer churn prediction emerges as a crucial task, allowing organizations to proactively address potential issues, implement tailored retention strategies, and maximize the value of recurring subscriptions.

This task focuses on leveraging machine learning techniques to analyze the Telco customer churn dataset, emphasizing the importance of predicting and mitigating customer churn for sustained business success [1], [2], [3] [4].
